# TinTuit - Research Paper Study Assistant

A Progressive Web App (PWA) that helps users study and retain knowledge from research papers through interactive questions and spaced repetition.

## Features

- ðŸ“š Browse and search research papers from multiple sources (arXiv, Semantic Scholar)
- ðŸ¤– AI-generated questions to test understanding
- ðŸ“Š Track study progress and retention
- ðŸ“± Offline support and PWA functionality
- ðŸŒ™ Dark mode support
- ðŸ“ˆ Detailed statistics and progress tracking

## Setup

1. API Keys:
   - Required: Anthropic API key (should already be in .env files)
   - Optional: Semantic Scholar API key (app will use only arXiv if not provided)
   - Note: arXiv API key not required

2. Configure Main App:
   ```bash
   cd /home/twain/Projects/tintuit
   npm install
   cp .env.example .env
   # Add your API keys to .env
   ```

3. Start Development Server:
   ```bash
   cd /home/twain/Projects/tintuit
   npm run dev
   ```
   The app will be available at http://localhost:5173

## Testing Checklist

1. Paper Search & Browse:
   - [ ] Search for papers by topic (e.g., "quantum computing")
   - [ ] Verify papers load with titles, authors, and abstracts
   - [ ] Check that paper metadata is loaded from arXiv (and optionally enriched with Semantic Scholar data if API key is provided)
   - [ ] Confirm papers are saved to IndexedDB (check DevTools -> Application -> IndexedDB)

2. Study Session:
   - [ ] Start a study session for a paper
   - [ ] Verify AI generates relevant questions
   - [ ] Answer questions and check validation works
   - [ ] Test different confidence levels
   - [ ] Verify progress is saved

3. Progress Tracking:
   - [ ] Check that answered questions are tracked
   - [ ] Verify confidence levels are recorded
   - [ ] Test daily streak tracking
   - [ ] Check per-paper progress tracking

4. Offline Support:
   - [ ] Load the app and search for papers
   - [ ] Turn off internet connection
   - [ ] Verify previously loaded papers are still accessible
   - [ ] Check that study sessions work offline
   - [ ] Turn internet back on and verify sync works

5. Dark Mode:
   - [ ] Toggle between light and dark modes
   - [ ] Verify all components render correctly in both modes

6. Error Handling:
   - [ ] Test with invalid search terms
   - [ ] Try accessing non-existent papers
   - [ ] Check error messages are user-friendly
   - [ ] Verify app recovers gracefully from API errors
